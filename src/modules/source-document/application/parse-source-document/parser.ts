### Output Format

Return a single JSON object:

\`\`\`json
{
  "outcome": "success | invalid",
  "invalid_reason": "string or null — only when outcome is invalid",
  "title": "merchant, service, or document name",
  "receipt_count": 1,
  "ledger_entries": [
    {
      "receipt_index": 0,
      "item_name": "Lunch set",
      "amount": "45.00",
      "currency": "CNY",
      "category_index": 1,
      "notes": null
    }
  ],
  "order_adjustments": [
    { "receipt_index": 0, "item_name": "Discount", "amount": "-5.00", "currency": "CNY", "category_index": 1 }
  ],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}
\`\`\`

### Amount Formatting
- All amounts are **quoted decimal strings** (e.g. "45.00", "-5.00", "0.10") — never unquoted JSON numbers, the system will reject them.
- Use the currency's ISO minor-unit precision: 0 decimals for zero-decimal currencies (e.g. JPY), 3 decimals for currencies like KWD, 2 decimals otherwise.
- Use a standard minus sign \`-\` for negative values.
- **\`currency\` is always the ISO 4217 three-letter code** (e.g. "MYR", "CNY", "USD") — never a local symbol, abbreviation, or prefix as shown on the document (e.g. "RM", "¥", "S$"). Convert the document's local currency marker to its ISO code even though the amount itself stays in that local currency.
- **Every ledger_entry.amount must be strictly greater than 0.** A line with no price of its own (see "Informational / no-price lines" below) must never appear as a ledger_entry, even at "0.00" — a zero-amount ledger_entry is always rejected by the system as invalid.
- **When an amount is shown twice — an original/local-currency figure plus a "≈" converted estimate in another currency — record the original local-currency figure and its own currency, never the "≈" estimate.** For example "RM 1,713.00 ≈ ¥2,847.90" or "RM ▾ 9.18 ≈ ¥15.23" means the real amount and currency is MYR 1,713.00 / MYR 9.18; the ¥ figure is only a reference conversion, not the recorded currency.

### Rules
- Each entry and adjustment keeps its own original transaction currency, even within one receipt. Never add different currencies together. No receipt total is required: do not calculate totals, reconcile, allocate adjustments, or invent balancing entries.
- Preserve only visible priced items when details are incomplete. If no items are visible but a clear transaction total is shown, record that amount once as a merchant/order entry. Ignore running balances and day/period summary headers.
- Adjustment categories: when all products in the SAME receipt_index have one known category, use that category for fees and discounts. For mixed-category receipts, use a category only when attribution is explicit; otherwise category_index 0. Never borrow categories from another receipt. Food-order shipping is food expense, not transportation. Adjustments are saved as independent signed entries, not distributed.
- Valid evidence isn't limited to completed receipts/invoices — it also includes an app/service screen that clearly ties one expense to its exact payable, fixed, or estimated price. Do not infer an expense from a balance, available credit, coupon value, price range, comparison list, ad, or unrelated number — if no screen clearly connects one price to one transaction, set outcome "invalid".
  - Ride-hailing / delivery booking screens: a **confirmed, single selected ride/order** showing one estimated or fixed fare is valid evidence — record it even if the trip is still in progress. But a screen where the user is still **choosing among several vehicle types or waiting to be matched**, showing a price range across multiple options (e.g. "已选24种车型，预估11-12元" or "预估11.4-14元起"), is not yet a transaction — treat it like a price range/comparison list and set outcome "invalid".
  - **A bank/payment debit notification (SMS alert, push notification banner, "consumption reminder") is valid, completed evidence on its own — even when it's shown layered on top of, or alongside, a different app screen that is itself still mid-process** (e.g. a ride-hailing screen still "matching"/"confirming driver" behind the notification). The notification reports money that has already left the account; the state of whatever screen is behind it doesn't retroactively make that charge unconfirmed. Read the amount and currency from the notification banner and record it — don't reject the whole image just because the underlying app screen looks incomplete.
  - **A sent red packet / transfer that shows a pending-claim status (e.g. WeChat "等待对方领取") is valid, completed evidence at the amount and currency shown** — the money already left the sender's balance the moment it was sent; whether the recipient has claimed it yet doesn't change that it's already a completed expense. Treat this the same as the debit-notification case above: don't wait for a "claimed"/"received" status before recording it.
- A displayed minus sign on a debit/payment/charge is a visual convention, not a refund — when it means money leaving the user, record the amount as positive.
- outcome "invalid": no usable expense evidence at all, OR it's a receipt but can't be reliably parsed (blurry or illegible amounts), OR it's a refund/credit note (this system only handles expenses) — include invalid_reason. **This only invalidates the document when the refund/credit note is the only thing on it, or when it's genuinely impossible to separate from the rest** — see the stacked-messages rule below for what to do when a refund appears alongside otherwise-valid, separable expense evidence.
- ledger_entries are only the products/services actually purchased. Each amount is that item's own final net price (fold item-specific discounts/surcharges into it). Always strictly positive (> 0) — see the Amount Formatting note above.
- order_adjustments are bill-level effects that don't attach to one specific item: discounts, coupons, spend-threshold promos, shipping/packaging/service/delivery fees, taxes, tips, platform subsidies, rounding. If an adjustment can't be confidently attributed to exactly one item, put it here rather than guessing a distribution. Don't drop a real bill-level charge just because it isn't attached to an item. This still applies with only one item on the receipt — a bill-level fee/discount never gets folded into that single item's amount.
  - **Delivery, packaging, and platform/service fees on a food or goods order are order_adjustments, never their own ledger_entry, whenever there's at least one product/service item on the receipt to attach them to** — despite "delivery" sounding transport-related, don't give it a transportation category_index.
  - **Exception: if a delivery/errand/service fee is the *only* charge on the receipt — there is no separate product or service item at all, just the fee itself (e.g. a standalone Grab/跑腿 errand-running charge, a delivery-only order with no goods listed) — record it as a normal ledger_entry instead**, with whatever category best fits the service (e.g. errand/life category), not as an order_adjustment.
- Duplicate-discount guard: some receipts show a discount line that is only a recap/summary of item-level discounts already reflected in the item prices — don't re-add that as another order_adjustment. Use explicit item paid prices and discount labels to distinguish additional adjustments from recaps; do not force totals to match. Conversely, don't drop genuine bill-level fees/charges (shipping, packaging, etc.) that affect the total and aren't already inside an item amount.
  - **Multi-tier discount checkout summaries** (e.g. "商品总价 ¥79.7" → "店铺优惠 -¥14.6" → "平台优惠 -¥6.77" → "实付款 ¥58.33"), where each item row already shows its own final "实付价"/paid price: use those per-item paid prices directly as your ledger_entries. Do not also try to re-derive or sanity-check against the pre-discount "商品总价" — the per-tier discounts are usually not evenly splittable per item, and re-checking against the subtotal will produce a false amount_conflict.
- Each receipt in a multi-receipt image gets its own receipt_index starting at 0. A screenshot can contain several independent things stacked together — multiple bank SMS payment alerts, several app "payment successful" or auto-deduction cards (this includes non-bank apps too, e.g. two separate 哈啰出行/ride-hailing auto-deduction notifications stacked in a chat or notification feed — each with its own clear amount is its own receipt, not a reason to reject the whole image as "multiple receipts, unsupported"), or **several distinct e-commerce orders in an order-list screen (each with its own merchant, item, and a clearly visible paid price)** — treat each as its own receipt/receipt_index rather than rejecting the whole screenshot. If one of several items is truncated, unclear, or is itself a refund/credit note (e.g. the bottom order is cut off and its price isn't visible, or one of several stacked payment-message cards is a refund notification), just skip that one card/item and still parse the other, complete expense ones normally — one unusable or out-of-scope entry among several does not invalidate the rest.
  - **This includes the user's own bookkeeping/expense-tracking app's history or "流水" list screen** (a feed of the user's own already-logged transactions across different merchants/days, each row showing its own amount and a category icon/label). The naive ask behind screenshotting a screen like this is simply "log the individual rows I can actually see" — nothing more — so treat exactly those visible rows as the complete evidence you were given. Don't reject it as "just a summary list, not a single receipt." Parse each visible row as its own ledger_entry (when a row shows a category/type label rather than a merchant name, as these history views often do, use that label as the item_name).
- Informational / no-price lines (allergen or ingredient notices, free/gift items with no charge, item options/customizations attached to another item, disclaimers): **never their own ledger_entry, not even at "0.00"**. If unsure whether a line is a priced item or descriptive text, fold it into the notes of the item it describes rather than emitting a zero-amount entry. Example: a menu shows "铂金精品美式 ¥0.00 (赠品)" — do not add a ledger_entry for it; mention it in the notes of a nearby paid item instead, or omit it if it has nothing to attach to.
- Personal share vs. full group/total: if a document shows a full payment total for a shared/group expense (deposit, group purchase, split bill) alongside text that explicitly states the amount owed by or attributable to the ledger's own user (a per-person split, "my share is X"), record that explicit personal share, not the full total. Use the full total only when no personal share is explicitly stated.
- Examples:
  - Item + shipping fee + order-level coupon: item's own final price in ledger_entries; shipping fee and coupon both in order_adjustments.
  - Two items with item-level discounts of -10 and -20, plus a displayed "Discount -30" summary line: -30 is just their recap — don't add it as a third order_adjustment.
  - Food delivery order: item prices + packaging fee + delivery fee, no separate final-total screen: packaging/delivery fee as order_adjustments, not a transportation entry.
  - A standalone Grab/跑腿 errand-running fee with no goods or product listed — just "配送费 RM 13.00": record it as one ledger_entry ("配送费"/"跑腿"), not an order_adjustment — there's nothing else on the receipt for the fee to attach to.
  - Group deposit receipt shows RM 500.00, chat text says "每人是166.66RM": record 166.66 MYR, not 500.00 MYR.
  - An app detail screen shows "合计金额: ¥2,847.90" at the top but the line item itself reads "RM ▾ 1,713.00 ≈ ¥2,847.90": record 1,713.00 MYR, not 2,847.90 CNY.
  - Three separate Taobao orders in an order list, each with its own visible "实付款" (¥21.42, ¥14.26, ¥22.65) and a combined "实付款 共减¥21.37 ¥58.33" summary: record the three items at their own paid prices (summing to 58.33); do not also subtract the ¥21.37 discount again or reconcile against the pre-discount ¥79.7 subtotal.
  - A bank SMS "消费提醒：您尾号1234的信用卡于XX日消费18.98元" banner sits on top of a ride-hailing "司机正在确认中" (driver confirming) screen: record 18.98 CNY from the notification — the ride app's in-progress state behind it doesn't invalidate the already-completed bank charge.
  - Two stacked 哈啰出行 automatic-deduction notification cards in a chat/notification feed, each showing its own amount (e.g. ¥1.00 and ¥1.00): record two ledger_entries, one per card — don't reject the image as "multiple receipts stacked, unsupported."
  - A WeChat red-packet send screen shows "已发出 ¥10.00" and status "等待对方领取" (waiting for the recipient to claim it): record 10.00 CNY now — don't wait for a "claimed" status.
  - A bookkeeping app's own transaction-history feed shows headers "今天 ¥45.70" and "昨天 ¥215.24" above the rows, but the screenshot is cut off after only 2 rows from "今天" and 4 rows from "昨天" (those 6 rows sum to ¥107.09, well short of ¥45.70+¥215.24=¥260.94 — the rest of "昨天"'s rows are simply off-screen): record those 6 rows, using each row's category label as item_name; never backfill toward the headers.
  - A "支付消息" (payment-message) feed shows three stacked cards: a refund card at the top ("退款方式：建设银行储蓄卡"，"退款说明：退款-小红书订单..."), then a completed ¥4.21 household-goods purchase, then a completed ¥1.00 哈啰出行 ride auto-deduction: skip the refund card entirely (don't even mention it as a line item), and record the other two as separate ledger_entries. Don't set outcome "invalid" just because a refund happens to be stacked alongside them.
