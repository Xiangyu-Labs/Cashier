![Cashier stream](./public/readme/stream-desktop.webp)

Cashier began as a bookkeeping tool I built for myself: take a photo of a receipt, or write
something like "lunch, $12", and let AI handle the tedious first pass. I am now opening it up as a
self-hosted project for people who want less data entry without giving up control of their records.

Cashier extracts dates, merchants, amounts, currencies, categories, and line items from images or
text. The result is not a black box: you can review, edit, and retry it, then continue working with
the record in the stream, details, and statistics views.

## What it does

- Records expenses from receipt or invoice images and natural-language notes
- Extracts titles, dates, amounts, currencies, categories, and line items
- Lets you review and edit AI results, anomalies, and possible duplicates
- Keeps original currencies while reporting totals in the ledger's main currency
- Provides stream, filtered detail, and statistics views
- Creates ledger-scoped API keys for scripts, Shortcuts, and integrations
- Includes Chinese and English interfaces

## Quick start

You only need Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xiangyu-Labs/Cashier.git
cd Cashier
cp .env.local.example .env
```

Set at least these three values in `.env`:

```dotenv
INITIAL_USER_EMAIL=you@example.com
INITIAL_USER_PASSWORD=choose-a-strong-password
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Start the bundled stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

On the first start, Cashier creates PostgreSQL, the MinIO bucket, the database schema, and the
initial user. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in with the email and
password you configured.

`AI_MODEL` defaults to `gpt-4o`. When using another OpenAI-compatible service, set both
`OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `AI_MODEL`.

For an existing PostgreSQL database, Cloudflare R2, or another S3-compatible service, see
[Deployment, upgrades, and backups (Chinese)](./docs/deployment.md).

## Before you use it

> **Project status: early public release**

- This is a personal project opened for testing and feedback. It does not yet have a stable release
  or compatibility policy.
- AI can misread a document or choose the wrong category. Review important records after parsing.
- Back up PostgreSQL and object storage before upgrading. The browser startup preview is not a
  backup.
- AI parsing requires network access and a working OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Cashier is a bookkeeping tool, not accounting, tax, or financial advice.

## Local development

Local development requires Node.js 24, PostgreSQL, and S3-compatible storage:

```bash
npm ci
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d \
  postgres minio storage-bootstrap
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
```

Before submitting a change, run:

```bash
npm run check
```
